# Day 7 of 100 days of Python

## What this is?
Hangman! 

## What about python does it showcase?
Everything we've done so far: lists, loops, conditionals, string manipulation, etc. Oh and some sweet ASCII art again! 

## How do I run it?
Clone or download this repo, and just run `python main.py` from inside this folder!
