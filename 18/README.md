# Day 19 of 100 days of Python

## What this is?
Etch-a-Sketch (but wait, there's more!) AND a turtle racing game

## How do I run it?
Clone or download this repo, and just run the following depending on the game:

### Etch-a-Sketch
`python sketch.py` from inside this folder!

- Use the 'WASD' keys to move forward, backward, and turn left and right.

### Turtle Racing
`python race.py` from inside this folder!

- Pick a color from the rainbow (indigo or violet are summed into one, purple) and hope your turtle wins the race!
