## What this is?
A GUI password manager which saves randomly generated (or user generated) passwords into a text file.

## How do I run it?
In order to have the "Generate Password" button automatically place the password in your clipboard, make sure to install pyperclip:

```
pip install pyperclip
```

Then, clone or download this repo, and just run `python main.py` to use it
